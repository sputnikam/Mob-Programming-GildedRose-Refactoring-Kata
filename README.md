**What tool (s) will you use to enable excellent f-2-f-like collaboration?**

I will recommend to use Microsoft teams.

**What are the Microsoft Teams features?**

Microsoft Teams is a persistent chat-based collaboration platform complete with document sharing, online meetings, and many more extremely useful features for business communications.

**Teams and channels** : Teams are made up of channels, which are conversation boards between teammates.

**Conversations within channels and teams** : All team members can view and add to different conversations in the General channel and can use an @ function to invite other members to different conversations, not unlike Slack.

**A chat function** : The basic chat function is commonly found within most collaboration apps and can take place between teams, groups, and individuals.

 **Document storage in SharePoint** : Every team who uses Microsoft Teams will have a site in SharePoint Online, which will contain a default document library folder. All files shared across all conversations will automatically save to this folder. Permissions and security options can also be customized for sensitive information.
 
**Online video calling and screen sharing** : Enjoy seamless and fast video calls to employees within your business or clients outside your business. A good video call feature is great to have on a collaboration platform. One can also enjoy simple and fast desktop sharing for technical assistance and multi-user real-time collaboration.

**Online meetings** : This feature can help enhance your communications, company-wide meetings, and even training with an online meetings function that can host up to 10,000 users. Online meetings can include anyone outside or inside a business. This feature also includes a scheduling aid, a note-taking app, file uploading, and in-meeting chat messaging.

**Audio conferencing** : This is a feature you won’t find in many collaboration platforms. With audio conferencing, anyone can join an online meeting via phone. With a dial-in number that spans hundreds of cities, even users that are on the go can participate with no internet required. Note this requires additional licensing.

**Full telephony** : That’s right! The days of seeking VoIP vendors and overspending on a phone system are finally over. Microsoft  365 Business Voice can completely replace your business’ existing phone system. Note this requires additional licensing.
